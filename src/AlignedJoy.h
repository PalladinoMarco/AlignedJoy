@description
AlignedJoy is a class written in C++ for Arduino to interface classic analog joysticks.
Reading the analog values of a joystick with Arduino is very simple, so what is the purpose of this class?
Through the methods of the class you can calibrate one or more joysticks, read and memorize the calibration points.
For dynamic applications, calibrated points can be stored in eeprom. Or once the calibration points are obtained,
they can be set in constant mode. See description of methods.
The strength of the class is that having the calibration parameters is able to align the values of the axes
of the respective joysticks. Itâ€™s very useful when you want to manage something with a certain precision and
when you have a joystick with misaligned axis values.

AXIS_TRAVEL CONSTANT
@description Minimum axis travel value from one end to the other (Xmax-Xmin).
             This parameter is used as a safety control during calibration or when setting extreme points
             using the "Setcalibrationpoint" method, in order to ensure a minimum excursion between the two
             points and in reference to the central point (joystick at rest).
